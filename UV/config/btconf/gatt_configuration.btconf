    <!--System ID-->
    <characteristic const="false" id="system_id" name="System ID" sourceId="org.bluetooth.characteristic.system_id" uuid="2A23">
      <informativeText>Abstract:  The SYSTEM ID characteristic consists of a structure with two fields. The first field are the LSOs and the second field contains the MSOs.       This is a 64-bit structure which consists of a 40-bit manufacturer-defined identifier concatenated with a 24 bit unique Organizationally Unique Identifier (OUI). The OUI is issued by the IEEE Registration Authority (http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/index.html) and is required to be used in accordance with IEEE Standard 802-2001.6 while the least significant 40 bits are manufacturer defined.       If System ID generated based on a Bluetooth Device Address, it is required to be done as follows. System ID and the Bluetooth Device Address have a very similar structure: a Bluetooth Device Address is 48 bits in length and consists of a 24 bit Company Assigned Identifier (manufacturer defined identifier) concatenated with a 24 bit Company Identifier (OUI). In order to encapsulate a Bluetooth Device Address as System ID, the Company Identifier is concatenated with 0xFFFE followed by the Company Assigned Identifier of the Bluetooth Address. For more guidelines related to EUI-64, refer to http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/tut/eui64.pdf.  Examples:  If the system ID is based of a Bluetooth Device Address with a Company Identifier (OUI) is 0x123456 and the Company Assigned Identifier is 0x9ABCDE, then the System Identifier is required to be 0x123456FFFE9ABCDE.  </informativeText>

      <informativeText>Abstract: The value length represents the (# of sensors * 2 * buffer size). Each sensor provides a 16-bit value representing 100 times the sunlight UV Index. The mobile device should divide this value by 100 to get the UV index from one sensor. A value of 0xFFFF means that sensor data is not available. The sensors are ordered from first to last. The sensor data is ordered from LSB to MSB. Example for 4 byte value length: [Sensor 0 LSB : Sensor 0 MSB : Sensor 1 LSB : Sensor 1 MSB]. The entire data buffer set is ordered from latest to most recent data.</informativeText>
